## Features

When a developer enters a command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

When a developer opens API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON object.

WHEN a developer tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, users and thoughts are successfully created, updated, and deleted (respectively) in my database.

WHEN a developer tests API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, reactions to thoughts are created and deleted, and friends are added and removed from the user's friend list.
